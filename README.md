# Train-time-delay-prediction-using-machine-learning
Train Time Delay Prediction,
Current train delay prediction systems do not take the advantage of modern tools and techniques for handling and extracting useful information from a large amount of historical train data collected by the national railway inquiry systems. The purpose of this project is to build a data-oriented machine learning based Train Delay Prediction System (TDPS) for large-scale railway networks which exploits the most recent learning algorithms. It will be not only predicting the delay of the today but for the future delays to up to any extent though the farther in the future, it is the more chances of noise increases.

We propose a Recurrent Neural Network Learning Algorithm that fully exploits the recent in-memory large-scale data processing technologies for predicting train delays.
